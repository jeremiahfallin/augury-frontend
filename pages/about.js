      <p>
        Augury is a game similar to the NFL's Eliminator Challenge for football.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each tournament you will be able to enter a set number of entries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of the game is for every set of matches (where the matches are
        grouped by the day or week they are played on in the season), pick a
        team from one of the matches that you think is going to win.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two catches. You can only use each team a set number of times,
        meaning you can't just pick the best team in the league to win every
        match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, if you pick a team a team to win a match and they lose, that
        entry is done.
      </p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
